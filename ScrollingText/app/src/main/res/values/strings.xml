    <string name="article_text">\nVerse \nYou\'ll be safe in my romance, babe
\nLabel\'s fading
\nBut I see you cravin\' for more
\nYou\'re denying it
\nBut you ain\'t controlling your actions
\nKeep me guessing
\nBut don\'t keep me waiting for us
        \n
        \nChorus
\nTake all the love that I give
\nAll that I wish is for you to take me
\nBut I taste the lies on your lips
\nI count the days when we\'re in love
\n\'Cuz I only matter when he\'s not around
\nOh but I live to appreciate you
\nSo take all the love that I give
        \n
        \nVerse
\nGot my heart on my sleeve
\nI\'m beggin\' the heavens to be good to me
\nAre you obsessive love?
\n\'Cuz I\'m tolerating all of your desires
\nI\'ll keep you wanting me more oh
\nLeave but I\'ll keep you comin\'
\nI\'m sure it\'s my love that got you suffocated
        \n
        \nChorus
\nOh I live to appreciate you
\nTake all the love that I give
\nAll that I wish is for you to take me
\nBut I taste the lies on your lips
\nI count the days when we\'re in love
\n\'Cuz I only matter when he\'s not around
Oh but I live to appreciate you
So take all the love that I give
\n
        \nBridge
        \ntake all the love that I give
        \n
        \nOutro
\nYou come over but not too often
\nYou don\'t visit \'cuz you got more options
        \nYou come over but not too often
\nYou don\'t visit \'cuz you got more options
        \n
